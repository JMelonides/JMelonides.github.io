If you don’t think that you have the mind of a programmer and that you are unable to learn how to program, then you are mistaken. Many people share the view that their intelligence is fixed, and cannot change. They think that because they are bad at one subject, they cannot improve. Some people might think that they they are bad at programming, and will stay that way forever. This is called the fixed mindset, and leads many people to believe that they cannot improve no matter what. Changing your intelligence is like changing your height. All you can do is try to avoid failure to maintain your status as smart. On the other hand, there are people who believe that every time you fail, you become smarter. Failures are an opportunity for growth. Instead of saying that you are terrible at something, you can say, “I can improve in this area to become even smarter!” If someone with this mindset is bad at programming, they don’t say that they are unintelligent, they say that they can improve and master this skill eventually. Your goal should not be to prove that you are good at something, it should be to learn. “If you believe intelligence is a fixed quantity, then every educational and professional encounter becomes a measure of much you have. If you believe intelligence is something you can increase, then the same encounters become opportunities for growth. In one view, intelligence is something you demonstrate; in the other, it’s something you develop” (120). In other words, exams aren’t to measure your current intelligence, they are to give you opportunities to grow. So if you are not a confident programmer, it doesn’t matter, because you can grow and develop until you master the skill. It’s not just about how much intelligence you have at the moment, it’s about the effort you put in, and the amount you want grow. Having a fixed mindset makes it harder learn and harder to put effort into programming, because no matter what, you have the same intelligence. If you have a growth mindset, you are more likely to put in more effort into programming so that you can improve.
