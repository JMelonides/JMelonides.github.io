Cookies and Sessions

	As indicated by the Computer Science definition, a cookie, which is otherwise called a HTTP cookie, a following cookie, or a program cookie, is a bit of content, no greater than 4 kilobytes, which is put away on the client's PC by a web server by means of a web program. Cookies are used to store information about user preferences on a certain website. Cookies can be received from a web server and sent back without any changes at all. When you attempt to get to a webpage, your web browser interfaces with a web server and it sends a solicitation for each individual page. At that point the web server answers by sending the asked for content and it all the while stores another cookie on your PC. Some cookies have expiration dates meaning they will go away after a certain date and will have to be renewed. As a user, it is usually your choice whether you want cookies enabled or not. Sometime cookies can be used for malicious purposes so it is the users’ choice if the benefits outweigh the risks. Sessions are a bit more complicated. Because HTTP doesn’t linger on multiple different webpages, and just focuses on one page at a time, we need cookies and sessions. Sessions use cookies to maintain connections with the server. A session is a server storage of information that is desired to persist throughout the user's interaction with the web site or web application. Instead of storing large and information that always changes using cookies in the user's browser, only a unique identifier is stored on the client’s end; the session id. The session id is used every time your browser makes an HTTP request. In summation cookies and sessions are very important to storing data, but they do make you vulnerable to cyber attacks.
